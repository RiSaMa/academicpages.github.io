This module focuses on the range of approaches, methodologies, techniques and tools for data analysis, and the use of data analysis findings to inform decision-making in an industrial / business context. It exposes students to a range of industry-standard statistical and data analysis techniques and tools, and fosters awareness of the challenges associated with working with large datasets. The module also covers topics related to the legal, social, ethical and professional issues associated with data storage and analysis. Students will undertake practical work including empirical data analysis and summarisation / presentation of the results to a range of relevant stakeholders.

I taught this module, which is oriented to undergraduate and postgraduate students, for a semestre under the supervision of Dr. Anthony Constantinou.
